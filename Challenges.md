# To document challenges

> Here i will document all the challenges that i faced while learning c++ from absolute basic to advance level problems

## Problem - 1 (Introduction)

**Problem**:

  As always i got a small problem in day one and it's not a bug, my code was not printing the output where i expect it to print

- My code was running without any error, but the output of the code was printing in the debugging console
- Long story short i was the problem with the command `Run c/c++ file`, that was the problem

**Solution**:

- Well the solution for that was simple i just need to download a extension called `code runner` and using the option `Run file` instead of `Run c/c++ file`
- [Article that helped me to solve this problem](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-and-run-c-cpp-code-on-visual-studio-code/)
